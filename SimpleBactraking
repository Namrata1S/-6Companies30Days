Ninja is trying to create a robot, which would talk to humans. Ninja is stuck at a particular phase where he wants the robot to create all possible sentences from a 2D array of words. 
Help Ninja in solving this problem. For a given 2D array of words, your task is to create all possible sentences that can be made using them.

import java.util.* ;
import java.io.*; 
public class Solution {
    public static void createSentences(ArrayList < ArrayList < String >> arr, ArrayList < ArrayList < String >> ans) {
        // Write your code here.
        int n = arr.size();
        int m = arr.get(0).size();
        ArrayList<String> cur = new ArrayList<>();
        solveBacktrack(arr,ans,cur,n,0);
    }
    public static void solveBacktrack(ArrayList < ArrayList < String >> arr, ArrayList < ArrayList < String >> ans,ArrayList<String> cur,int n,int r){
       if(r == n){
         ans.add(new ArrayList<>(cur));
         return;
       }
       for(String word : arr.get(r)){
           cur.add(word);
           solveBacktrack(arr,ans,cur,n,r+1);
           cur.remove(word);
       }
    }
}
