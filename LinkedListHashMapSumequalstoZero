anya is preparing for her coding interviews. Recently she discovered about a Singly linked list. A singly linked list is a linear data structure in which we can traverse only in one direction, i.e., from Head to Tail. It consists of several nodes where each node contains some data and a reference to the next node.

A sample Linked List


But she doesn’t like those consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0. As she is a beginner, she requested you to help her remove such consecutive sequences from the linked list. Formally, your task is to repeatedly remove consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to 0 and occur first in the singly linked list until there are no such sequences.

Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
Sample Input 1:
2
-2 4 -2 1 -1
1 3 5 -8 2 3 -1
Sample Output 1:
1
1 2 3
Explanation for sample input 1:
Test case 1:
The given linked list is shown below.

The first consecutive sequence of nodes that sum to 0 is  [-2, 4, -2].
After removing this sequence of nodes, the resulting list is [1].
Now there’s no consecutive sequence of nodes that sum to 0. Therefore the final list will be [1].

   // Following is the class structure of the LinkedListNode class:

    // class LinkedListNode {
    //     public int data;
    //     public LinkedListNode next;

    //     LinkedListNode(int data) {
    //         this.data = data;
    //         this.next = null;
    //     }
    // }



public class Solution {
    public static linkedListNode zeroConsecutiveNodes(linkedListNode head) {
        // Write your code here.
        linkedListNode dummy = new linkedListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        linkedListNode cur = dummy;
        HashMap<Integer,linkedListNode> map = new HashMap<>();
        int cursum = 0;
        while(cur != null){
           cursum += cur.data;
           if(map.containsKey(cursum)){

             int sum = cursum;
             while(temp != cur){
                 sum += temp.data;
                 map.remove(sum);
                 temp = temp.next;

           }else{
               map.put(cursum,cur);
           }
           cur = cur.next;

        return dummy.next;
    }
