The exam scores for a class of N students have been released. The marks obtained by each student are stored in an array of scores[], where scores[i] represent the marks of the ith student.As the class monitor, Ram is tasked with answering queries from the teacher. The teacher will ask Q queries, and for each query, Ram needs to determine how many students have scored at least X marks.Your objective is to help Ram by finding the number of students who have scored at least X marks for each query.
